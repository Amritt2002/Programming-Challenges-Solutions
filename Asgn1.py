#Q3. Explain the use of the following operators using an example:

#(i)	/
#this is a divison operator and it is use to divide the numbers and to get result.
a=6/2

#(ii)	% 
#this is  a modulo operator which is use to divide the number and get the remainder only.
b=5%2

#(iii)	//
#this  is a division floor operator and gives quotient or result. 
f=6//3

#(iv)	**
#this is power operator use to guve the power to a number
g= 5**2

print(a)
print(b)
print(f)
print(g)

Q4. Create a list of length 10 of your choice containing multiple types of data. Using for loop print the 
element and its data type.
   
my_list = [42, "Hello, World!", 3.14159, True, [1, 2, 3], {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, None, (4, 5, 6), 7.5, False]

for item in my_list:
    print(f"Element: {item}, Data Type: {type(item)}")

#Q5. Using a while loop, verify if the number A is purely divisible by number B and if so then how manytimes it can be divisible.
# Input the two numbers A and B
# Input the two numbers A and B
A = int(input("Enter number A: "))
B = int(input("Enter number B: "))

# Initialize a counter to keep track of how many times A can be divided by B
count = 1
temp = B
# Use a while loop to repeatedly divide A by B until it's no longer divisible
while A >= temp:
    temp+=temp
    count+=1
    

# Check if A is reduced to 0, indicating it was purely divisible by B
if A % B == 0:
    print(f"{B} can divide {A} purely {count} times.")
else:
    print(f"{B} cannot divide {A } purely.")

#Q6. Create a list containing 25 int type data. Using for loop and if-else condition print if the element is divisible by 3 or not.

Q7 Q7. What do you understand about mutable and immutable data types? Give examples for both showing
this property.
"""Immutable Data Types:

Immutable data types are those where the data cannot be changed after it is created. When you perform an operation that appears to modify an immutable data type, you're actually creating a new object with the modified value, leaving the original object unchanged.
Examples of Immutable Data Types:

Integers (int): Once an integer is assigned to a variable, it cannot be changed. Any operation that seems to change the integer results in a new integer.
Strings (str): Strings are also immutable. Any operation that seems to modify a string creates a new string."""
#EX:1
x = 5  # x is assigned the integer 5
x = x + 1  # A new integer (6) is created and assigned to x
#EX:2
s = "Hello"  # s is assigned the string "Hello"
s = s + " World"  # A new string is created ("Hello World") and assigned to s

"""Mutable Data Types:

Mutable data types, on the other hand, can be modified in place. This means you can change their content without creating a new object.
Examples of Mutable Data Types:

Lists (list): Lists are mutable. You can modify their elements, append, remove, or change values within the same list."""

#EX:1
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.append(4)  # Modifies the original list by adding 4

#EX:2
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
my_dict["age"] = 31  # Modifies the age value in the original dictionary
